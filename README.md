# CPP01 – 42 C++ Module

This was one of **C++ projects** at 42 School. It’s a small but crucial exercise designed to get hands-on experience with **basic C++ concepts**: classes, constructors, destructors, member functions, and operator overloading.

---

## Overview

`CPP01` focuses on understanding the foundations of object-oriented programming in C++. The project typically involves creating simple classes, managing class instances, and ensuring proper memory management.

> Think of this as the first step in learning to write clean, maintainable C++ code.

---

## Features

* Creation of **basic C++ classes**
* Implementation of **constructors and destructors**
* Member functions to manipulate class data
* Overloading operators for custom behavior
* Proper memory and object management

---

## Installation

### Requirements

* macOS or Linux
* `g++` (or compatible C++ compiler)
* `make`

### Build

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd cpp01
cd <exercise number> # change to the directory of the exercise you want to build
make
./<executable>
```

---

## Usage

* The project typically comes with tests or examples provided by 42.
* Run the compiled executable to see the classes in action.

---

## Notes

* This was my **first official C++ project**—a milestone in learning object-oriented programming.
* The focus is on mastering **C++ syntax, object management, and basic OOP principles**.

---

## Languages

* C++ — 91.8%
* Makefile — 8.2
